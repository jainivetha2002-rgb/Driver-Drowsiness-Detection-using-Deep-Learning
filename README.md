# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Driver fatigue is a major cause of road accidents worldwide. Drowsiness reduces a driver’s alertness, reaction time, and decision-making ability. This project develops a computer vision–based deep learning system that detects driver fatigue by analyzing eye closure and yawning behavior from facial images.
